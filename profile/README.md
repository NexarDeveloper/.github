<h1 align="center"><b>Welcome to the Nexar Developer GitHub</b></h1>

The Nexar API is a GraphQL based API that brings together many elements of the electronics industry. This includes:

- Comprehensive supply data from Octopart
- Design information from Altium 365
- Manufacturing information via Altimade
- Intelligent and actionable insights for design, supply and manufacturing via Spectra

If you haven't already, you can sign up for a Nexar account on [our website](https://nexar.com/). If you aren't familiar with GraphQL, you may find it useful and interesting to go through [GraphQL's tutorial](https://graphql.org/learn/). If you are stuck and need some help, you can browse [our documentation or reach out to support](https://support.nexar.com/support/home).

    Component Supply Data from Octopart
</h3>

We recommend that you start with the [nexar-first-supply-query](https://github.com/NexarDeveloper/nexar-first-supply-query) which shows you how to query the supply side of the API in a simple console app. There are scripts in Python, Javascript and C#.

If you want to see a larger application using the supply API, please see our [supply web demo](https://web-supply-demo.nexar.com/), and it's [code on GitHub](https://github.com/NexarDeveloper/web-supply-demo-blazor).

    Your Altium 365 Design Information
</h3>

We recommend that you start with the [nexar-first-design-query](https://github.com/NexarDeveloper/nexar-first-design-query) which shows you how to query the design side of the API in a simple console app. This example has scripts in Python and Javascript.

If you want to see a larger application using the design API, please see our [design web demo](https://web-design-demo.nexar.com/), and it's [code on GitHub](https://github.com/NexarDeveloper/web-design-demo-blazor).
